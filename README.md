This is my customized zshrc file. For make this file works it's necessary install the programs:
 - batcat
 - neovim
 - lsd
 - VSCodium (install by flatpak)
 - The default terminal is KiTTY

It's necessary install the theme Powerlevel10k (https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
Thanks and enjoy :)
